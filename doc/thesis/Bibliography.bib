	abstract = {Warragamba Dam, a concrete gravity dam, creates Lake Burragorang, the primary reservoir for water supply for the Australian city of Sydney, New South Wales.
The dam impounds the Coxs, Kowmung, Nattai, Wingecarribee, Wollondilly, and Warragamba rivers, within the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment; and the dam wall is located approximately 65 kilometres (40 mi) to the southwest of Sydney central business district, near the town of Wallacia. Constructed between 1948 and 1960, the dam created capacity for a reservoir of 2,031 gigalitres (4.47×1011 imp gal; 5.37×1011 {US} gal) and is fed by a catchment area of 9,051 square kilometres (3,495 sq mi). The surface area of the lake covers 75 square kilometres (29 sq mi) of the now flooded Burragorang Valley. Enhancements to the dam were completed in 2009, including the addition of an auxiliary spillway to manage extreme flood events.
A small hydroelectric power station is incorporated into the design of the dam and may operate at times of peak discharge; but has rarely generated power in recent years.
In early March 2012, the dam spilled for the first time in fourteen years, as a result of heavy rainfall in the catchment during February 2012. This spill followed a period of prolonged drought which saw the dam fall to historic lows of below 33 percent in 2007.},

It covers the entire scope of the subject in a lucid manner starting from the fundamentals of hydrology, to various hydraulic and civil structures to electrical and mechanical equipment as required for hydro-power projects. Many new issues and challenges voiced in the energy sector in general and water power in particular during the last decade have been addressed in the book. Recent innovations and developments in some areas like wave power, and new technologies in hydraulic structures, like the P-K weirs, fuse gates, stepped spillways, {CFRD}, {RCC}, etc., find place suitably in the book. The book is meant for undergraduate and postgraduate students of civil and electrical engineering and for the professionals interested in the subject. {NEW} {IN} {THE} {SECOND} {EDITION} ♦ Thoroughly rewritten text; takes account of the new and growing technology, including   • New types of dams, sedimentation of reservoirs, rehabilitation of dams   • Spillway design floods, new types of spillways   • Mathematical models for rainfall-runoff analysis, including contribution of      snowfall   • Structural components of tidal plants, and new types of turbines   • Wave power exploitation ♦ Detailed study on Sardar Sarovar and Tehri projects ♦ Fully updated with the latest data, up to 2013 ♦ Two new chapters on \&\#39;small-scale hydro, and \&\#39;environmental impact of hydro and multi-purpose projects’},

	abstract = {A spillway is a structure used to provide the controlled release of flows from a dam or levee into a downstream area, typically being the river that was dammed. In the {UK} they may be known as overflow channels. Spillways release floods so that the water does not overtop and damage or even destroy the dam. Except during flood periods, water does not normally flow over a spillway. In contrast, an intake is a structure used to release water on a regular basis for water supply, hydroelectricity generation, etc. Floodgates and fuse plugs may be designed into spillways to regulate water flow and dam height. Other uses of the term "spillway" include bypasses of dams or outlets of a channels used during highwater, and outlet channels carved through natural dams such as moraines.},

This method is an example of explicit time integration where the function that defines governing equation is evaluated at the current time. Later, the method was given a more rigorous treatment in an article co-authored by John von Neumann.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes the use of a Grid Convergence Index ({GCI}) for the uniform reporting of grid refinement studies in Computational Fluid Dynamics. The method provides an objective asymptotic approach to quantification of uncertainty of grid convergence. The basic idea is to approximately relate the results from any grid refinement test to the expected results from a grid doubling using a second-order method. The {GCI} is based upon a grid refinement error estimator derived from the theory of generalized Richardson Extrapolation. It is recommended for use whether or not Richardson Extrapolation is actually used to improve the accuracy, and in some cases even if the conditions for the theory do not strictly hold. A different form of the {GCI} applies to reporting coarse grid solutions when the {GCI} is evaluated from a “nearby” problem. The simple formulas may be applied a posteriori by editors and reviewers, even if authors are reluctant to do so.},

	abstract = {In mathematics, the Gibbs phenomenon, discovered by Henry Wilbraham (1848) and rediscovered by J. Willard Gibbs (1899), is the peculiar manner in which the Fourier series of a piecewise continuously differentiable periodic function behaves at a jump discontinuity. The nth partial sum of the Fourier series has large oscillations near the jump, which might increase the maximum of the partial sum above that of the function itself. The overshoot does not die out as n increases, but approaches a finite limit. This sort of behavior was also observed by experimental physicists, but was believed to be due to imperfections in the measuring apparatuses.
This is one cause of ringing artifacts in signal processing.},

	abstract = {Geophysical hazards – landslides, tsunamis, volcanic avalanches, etc. – which lead to catastrophic inundation are rare yet devastating events for surrounding communities. The rarity of these events poses two significant challenges. First, there are limited data to inform aleatoric scenario models, how frequent, how big, where. Second, such hazards often follow heavy-tailed distributions resulting in a significant probability that a larger-than-recorded catastrophe might occur. To overcome this second challenge, we must rely on physical models of these hazards to “probe” the tail for these catastrophic events. We will present an emulator-based strategy that allows great speed-up in Monte Carlo simulations for creating probabilistic hazard forecast maps. This approach offers the flexibility to explore both the impacts of epistemic uncertainties on hazard forecasts and of non-stationary scenario modeling on short term forecasts.
