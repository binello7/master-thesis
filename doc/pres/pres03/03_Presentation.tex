% MASTER THESIS GOALS
  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Master thesis goals}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Get an overview of emulation
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Learn about \emph{interpolation}, \emph{intrapolation} and \emph{extrapolation}
        \item Learn about \emph{Gaussian Processes}
      \end{itemize}
      \item Find an appropriate \emph{open source} hydrological simulator
      \begin{itemize}
      %\itemsep0em
        \item Learn its \emph{functioning} and \emph{customize} it for the required scope
        \item Produce \emph{test datasets} usable for emulation
      \end{itemize}
      \item Perform emulation with a \emph{didactic} example
      \begin{itemize}
      %\itemsep0em
        \item Mechanistic emulator: \emph{the weir equation}
      \end{itemize}
      \item Perform emulation in an \emph{hydrological} context
      \begin{itemize}
      %\itemsep0em
        \item Hydrological emulator: \emph{time-to-threshold emulator}
      \end{itemize}
      \item Draw conclusions about emulation potential, especially applied to the \emph{hydrology},
            \emph{urban water} and \emph{water management} fields
    \end{itemize}
