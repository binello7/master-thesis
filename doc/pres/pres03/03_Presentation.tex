% * In this first case study we want to fit the weir equation to simulated data.
% * In a while we will see what relation this has with emulation and machine learning.
% * The weir equation can be derived analytically by assuming no friction losses and 
%   a uniform velocity distribution.
% * Results obtained are for a theoretical discharge, which diverges from empirical results, where
%   the assumption mentioned don't hold.
% * In order to obtain actual discharge a correction factor \mu has to be taken into account.
% * \mu is dependent on the type and shape of weir (broad-crested/narrow-crested) and which
%   particular shape.
% * To obtain the value of this coefficient the equation has to be fitted to 
%   experimental data.
% * Here below some \mu-values for some weir types are shown

% * 3 different fittings were done
% * Weir equation follows a power law, therefore the logarithm of the data was taken
%   and a linear regression was performed with all data.
%   values of \mu = 0.56 and a = 1.59 were found.
% * A linear interpolation was performed. performs very bad at the beginning (few points),
%   but quite good afterwards (almost overlaying).
% * A spline interpolation was performed. This performs good even between points
%   1 and 2 (almost overlaying).
% * I wanted to test the robustness of the different methods
% * I took a subset of the training dataset (14 points, otherwise computation too long) and
%   performed cross-validation leaving out 1, 2, ... up to 10 points.
% * Every time all possible combination of left-out points were tested and the
%   mean squared error was computed.
% * The plot shows the mean of the mean squared errors of all possible subsets by
%   leaving out 1, 2, ... 10 points.
% * When 10 points were left out just 4 were used for training: 1st, last + 2 random points.
% * From the plot we see some interesting features:
% * The  linear fit always performs the worst, although not even that bad: RMSE of ~2cm
%   leaving out 1 point.
% * The spline fit performs very good, better than the weir equation model thanks to its
% * very high flexibility. However, its error increases very rapidly by reducing
%   the number of training points. There is no prior knowledge encoded in the spline model,
%   it is just a fit to the data. When there are few training points the spline can move
%   very freely in between, and get far from the points generated by the process.
% * With 9 and 10 points left out the spline model performs worse than the weir equation model.
% * The weir equation encodes prior knowledge: the physics of the process.
% * The error here grows very slowly, the model performs very well even if trained on 4 points, 
%   and here actually better than the spline model.
% * Take home message: if we have knowledge about the process we don't need data

\section{Case study 2: time-to-threshold}

  \end{frame}
% * Building an emulator to estimate the time to threshold:
%   Our hydraulic structures (bridges, embankments, ...) have thresholds for which they were
%   sized. If those thresholds are exceeded, then the structure cannot fulfill its function.
% * Measures have to be taken in this case, build up temporary flood-blocking barriers,
%   evacuate people, etc.
% * We want to build up an emulator able, for a given catchment, knowing the rain intensity
%   over the catchment and the initial moisture content of its soil, to estimate after how long
%   the threshold discharge value at its outlet will be exceeded.
% * Such an emulator could for example be used as an early flood warning system

                {code.m}
  \end{frame}
% * For this case study the synthetic topography that you see here was created using
%   the open source tool "GNU Octave"
% * This represents a catchment of 2 km x 2 km and is composed of three "Gaussian bumps"
%   on a sloping plane. The three Gaussian bumps generate a Y-shaped channel which goes
%   from the top of the catchment up to the bottom.
% * The synthetic topography presents a surface which is very smooth. This way a coarse
%   grid resolution can be used, without having loss of important features.
% * As for the first case study, the simulator "FullSWOF_2D" was used for running the simulations.
% * 50 different rain events were simulated on this topography.
% * Every simulated rain event is distinguished by a different combination of the parameters
%   initial soil moisture content and rain intensity. 
% * All of the other simulation parameters were kept the same.
% * A linearly spaced grid was used for the parameters sampling:
% * 10 Rain intensity values were taken in the interval [10, 35] mm/h and 5 initial
%   moisture content values were taken in the interval [0, 1].
% * The rain event duration was set to 6 hours and the simulation duration to 9.
% * This is in order to observe the behavior after the rain has stopped.
% * The domain boundary conditions were set to "wall boundary condition", except from the lower one.
% * This way water can only outflow through the lower boundary.
% * Spatially distributed parameters such as Manning coefficients, hydraulic conductivity and maximum
%   infiltration rate were kept uniform over the domain.
% * The initial soil moisture content was also applied uniformly to the domain.

  \end{frame}
% * Here we can see the results extracted from the simulations. The plot shows the
%   different hydrographs at the channel outlet generated by the 50 different simulations.
% * The x-axis shows the time and z-axis the discharge. The y-axis corresponds 
%   to rain intensity. The initial soil saturation theta_i is indicated by the
%   different color tones. The red frame indicates the end of the rain events. From there
%   all hydrographs start to recess.
% * We can notice that some rain events produced absolutely no channel discharge.
% * Those with high initial soil saturation reached their peak discharge very fast.
% * Many hydrographs show an interesting behavior: a first plateau after some time,
%   where it seems that discharge won't grow any more, followed by one or two bumpy 
%   increases. These bumps are given by the topography. Two droplets at the same distance
%   from the outlet don't necessary have the same travel time. Those coming from
%   the "Gaussian mountains" will travel faster due to the slope. Those bumps are then
%   given by the water from the "plain" which is arriving later.

% CASE STUDY 2: EXTRACT EMULATOR DATASET
  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Emulator dataset extraction}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/hydrograph.png}
  \end{frame}
% * The emulator we want to build should estimate the time needed by a given
%   rain event to generate the channel threshold discharge.
% * For this a threshold has to be chosen.
% * Here we can see, that depending on the threshold value Q! that we select,
%   the time-to-threshold t! can vary enormously: in the hydrograph raising limb
%   region fair variations of Q-threshold have almost no effect.
% * In the plateau region shown here by the two black lines the opposite is true:
%   a very small variation of the threshold value causes huge sudden variations 
%   of the time-to-threshold.
% * We conclude that the time-to-threshold is a very discontinuous quantity,
%   which is therefore very challenging to emulate.
